Project Overview
The purpose of the application is to provide a game similar to classic asteroid shooters using Swift and SpriteKit. A user will be able to sign up to the game and pick a username that will be displayed on a scoreboard depending on their game score and the list will be sorted and put in ascending behaviour to indicate position on the scoreboard. The user can use their watch at any time to check the scoreboards to see if they have moved down in position of the scoreboard. User has the option to login and play again, if the highest score changed his position will also be changed in the scoreboard. 
Game has background music and the user will be able to do a special score or move with the help of gestures.Difficulty of the game will be changed with respect to time and current score of the player.
We will be using XCode (version 12.5.1 for the SDK), Swift UI interface, UIkit App Delegate Lifecycle and Swift Language.
